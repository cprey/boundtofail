## Welcome to The Build a SAAS App with Flask Course!

*A video course where we build a real world web application with Flask, Celery,
Redis, PostgreSQL, Stripe and Docker.*

**Full details on the course can be found here:**  
[https://buildasaasappwithflask.com](https://buildasaasappwithflask.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=bsawf&utm_campaign=readme-top)

### Getting started

```sh
cp .env.example .env
cp docker-compose.override.example.yml docker-compose.override.yml
docker-compose up --build
```

After everything is up and running, visit http://localhost:8000.

### How does this source code differ than what's in the course?

In the course we build up a 4,000+ line Flask application in 15 stages while
I'm at your side explaining my thought process along the way. You will get to
see the source code grow from a single `app.py` file to a large code base that
spans across dozens of files and folders.

#### This repo includes up to the 6th stage. By this point in the code base, you'll be introduced to concepts such as:

- Using Docker to "Dockerize" a multi-service Flask app
- Using Flask extensions
- Flask blueprints
- Jinja templates
- Working with forms
- Sending e-mails through Celery
- Testing and analyzing your code base

#### The rest of the course covers topics such as:

- A crash course on Docker and Docker Compose (including multi-stage builds)
- Going over the application's architecture and tech choices
- Creating a full blown user management system
- Creating a custom admin dashboard
- Logging, middleware and error handling
- Using Click to create custom CLI commands
- Accepting recurring credit card payments with Stripe
- Building up a dice game called "Snake Eyes"
- Responding with JSON from Flask and creating AJAX requests
- Processing microtransaction payments with Stripe
- Dealing with database migrations
- Converting your app to support multiple languages (i18n)
- A crash course on Webpack, ES6 JavaScript and SCSS

**By the time you finish the course, you'll have all the confidence you need to
build a large web application with Flask**.

There's over 187 video lessons, 25+ hours of content, coding exercises and an
e-book that's included. You also get free updates for life as well as life time
support. I've added 15+ hours of free updates over the years.

These updates range from adding new features like Webpack to keeping Python,
Node and all package / service versions up to date. There's even 1 update
that's a 5 hour live recording where I updated a bunch of things at once. This
includes using git too (making good commits, interactive rebasing, etc.), live
debugging and Googling for errors.

Also as a bonus, there's an additional 18 video lessons and 3 hours of content
that covers building a separate RESTful API driven application that uses
websockets.
